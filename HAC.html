ga mashie is one of the fourteen states of ga-dangme.it is also called central accra and forms part of the capital city of ghana.it is a showpiece of tradition and modern ,history,culture and development ,continuity 
and change .ga mashie has seven divisions/'akutso',asere ,gbese,abola ,otublohum,sempe,akumadze,alata.each has a number of sub division or 'wei' ancestral homes under it .each 'akutso'is headed by a mantse.all these were at one point in history put under one head mantse but now divided into two; jamestown mantse and ga mantse . 
<br>
a significant feature of ga-dangme culture is religion.the ga believe in a supreme being 'ataa naa nyɔnmɔ	' who created all things .some acknowledge subsidiary gods or deities such as sea,lagoons and other water bodies,the earth ,rain etc.the priests of the diesties were originally the rulers of the sub-states
before the mantse took over.the dieties are organised in hierarchies and families and are so numerous that their number is not known.a libation prayer admits :<br>
<br>'nlee nmaa kulutin ayibɔ in male nye yibɔi'.<br>
how would i know your numbers if i do not know<br> the number of grains on a millet.<br>
come and drink both great and small.<br><br>
in the seventeenth century,the kingdom of accra was very strong politically and economically ,spreading from lamma in the west to ada shwulai in the east.accra had several states under its territory including akwamu.ga mashie was called little accra and was part of the kingdomthe capital of the kingdom was inland at the present day site of ayawaso.at that time ,it was called greater accra. 
greater accra was a major economical center.a mega market was establisehd called abonse behind the capital and all other states brought their goods to sell to the people of accra.the goods were brought to the coast to trade .the coast was also a great economic resource.apart from fishing and salt making ,the people of accra traded with europeans from their ships as well as in the forts built by the europeans with permission
were the portuguese who were kicked out for misconduct.the dutch,english,swedes and danes were also allowed to build trading establishment from osu to accra .as a result the accra coast has three forts.the dutch fort crevecouer which was renamed ussher fort,james fort belong the english and christianburg belonging to the danes.
<br><br>
apart from large sums of money which europeans paid to the king of accra,they also paid rent every month and made other payments in the form of gifts at festivals and whenever the king and hus messangers visited the forts .there were payments fromtaxes at abonse market and revenue from the ships and forts.the king of accra became so powerfulthat he was envied by other rulers.
under these circumstances ,akwamu conspired with some of the elders of accra to get rid of mantse okaikwei,the accra king. a war ensued which ended with the defeat of the 'ga'.some of the elders crossed the volta to togo 'glidzi'.the rest of the people came down to little accra and stayed under the dutch fort 'crevecouer'.their descendants are the present 'aseres'and those who came out of asere.<br> 
<br>
the harshness of this period is captured in the 'kple' songs ,religious songs of the 'ga'.but  the 'ga' people never gave up.they are well known for their resilience and indefeatability .after fifty years ,they marshalled their forces,sought alliance from akyem and gave the akwamus a crushing defeat thats ent them across the volta to settle in the present fa akwamufie.akyem also had a war with the asantes in 1742
which ended in akyem defeat.asante took over the rents of the forts . a major test of ga unity came 1777-1780 when a war erupted between the dutch and danes over property in the dangme coast.the ga were divided into two as danish ga and dutch ga.in the course of the war,the deity of la known as lakpa made a pronoouncement that he was not going to continue with the fight.<br>
 'nhuu ta ko dann ee nhunta ko donn.<br>

 Dane blofo awo eta ni eya<br>
 
 huu<br>
 
 Nhuu ta ko don'<br>

 Kuku blofo awo eta ni eya huu''<br>


 'I am no longer fighting any war. <br>
 The Danish white man should take his war and fight. <br>
 The Dutch white man should take his war and fight. <br>
 
 at this juncture.the ga combatants stopped fighting to the bewilderment and disapproval of the europeans.the ga explained that they cannot continue fighting against their own brothers.they had a philosophy that in any solution they must forgo their right in order to have peace .
 <br> <br>
 the next war which the ga fought was the 'katamanso war' against the asante by the fantes,british and other states .the ga and their allies won the war and peace was established . 
 these were events at the period that brought signicant changes in accra .the slave trade was replaced by legitimate trade in palm oil and other products .the missionaries came from europe 
 bringing the gospel and literacy with them which laid the foundation of education for education another landmark in the history of the ga people.
 <br> <br>
in the nineteenth century,the european traders started leaving the gold coast.the danes left in 1850 and sold their forts and properties to the english.this was followed by the dutch who left in 1872.britian was left alone and took charge of the whole coast.britian declared the gold coast a british colony in 1874 and moved the capital from cape coast to accra in 1877.christianburg castle till jubilee house took over as the seat of government .

<br><br>
socially, accra has been subject to natural disasters,droughts,a major earthquake and other challenges such as epidemics 
which led to dispersion of thier population.      The British colonial government established policies that encouraged big European firms to start companies such as UAC, SCOA, PZ. Others included Indian, Lebanese firms as well as the Kwahus, etc. All these commercial activities depended to a large extent on the Ga women who filled the largest market Makola with economic and social activities. They bought on credit from the big firms and sold on credit to small scale traders in Accra and markets outside the cityThey formed self-help credit union with local names like;
<br>
Nanemiei Akpee - Friends' Society<br>

Nyenimei Akpee - Sibling Society<br>

Tipenfoi Akpee - Peers Society<br>

Twusai Akpee - Orphans Society<br>

Molonalai Akpee - Compassionate Society.<br>

These societies helped them to mobilise capital for infusion into their businesses,building projects, paying for their children's education, entertainment and helping each other with social responsibilities such as child birth, marriage and funerals. It is this strong base in our society together with labour unions and associations that supported Dr. Kwame Nkrumah in winning the election for Ghana's independence from colonial rule. These same women held the fort during the economic crisis Ghana went through in subsequent years but they attracted so much rancour
during the Rawlings regime that Makola Market was bombed. This broke the back of the Makola women causing death and destruction of the education of most of their children and wards.

Urbanisation has brought so many people and facilities to Accra and created a fascinating mixture of cultural traditions, development and history. Whiles babies are being ushered into the land of the living by outdooring ceremonies, they are being baptized and dedicated into churches. Whiles people are getting married traditionally. weddings are going on in churches. Whilst others visit deities for consultation others go to the Christian prophets, Rev ministers and pastors for ministration. Whilst some find div sion in the dance halls, cemas halls and discotheques, others are in the churches.

          <h2 class="title">A BRIEF HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE THE GA PEOPLE   </h2>
         
    
        <div class="row content">
         

<h6 class="hac">
  The Gã language is closely related to and somewhat mutually intelligible with Danme (also spelled "Dangme").
   There is also affinity between Gã and the Guan languages (spoken in parts of coastal Ghana, the Eastern Region 
   and in the Volta and Oti River basins) and to some extent Akan and Ewe. Most of the languages historically spoken 
   in southern Ghana belong to a family of West African tongues known to linguists as Kwa. Kwa includes Yorùbá, Fon-Aja 
   and Igbo and is a subdivision of the Niger-Congo branch of African languages.<br>
<br><br>
The Gã and Danme peoples have long fascinated local and foreign scholars and writers who for centuries have speculated about their origins. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, western-educated Gã cultural writers, historians, Protestant clergymen and lawyers such as Carl Reindorf, J.M. Bruce-Myers, Aaron Boi Quartey-Papafio and E.A Ammah began to imply or assert that the Gã and Danme
 peoples migrated from the east - variously interpreted as Ile Ife, the Benin Empire (both in modern Nigeria) or more fancifully ancient Egypt and Israel.2 These claims of external Gã origins were largely rooted in what anthropologists of colonial Africa called the Hamitic hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, so-called 'civilizing' influences such as centralized states, bureaucracies, agriculture, sedentary urban settlements and sophisticated religions and philosophical ideas were supposedly imparted to 'black Africa' by invading 'Caucasoids' from North Africa, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean lands of the Near East. Various forms of these ahistorical hypotheses were
 also applied to the Akan and Ewe and taught in colonial and missionary schools and these narratives became central to the identities of educated Gold Coast Africans. By connecting their ethnic and national origins to ancient or biblical lands, Western-educated Africans were anxious to claim historic centres of "civilization."3 For many Gold Coast Christian converts, these narratives and imagined connections to biblical lands served as useful polemics against European claims of African cultural inferiority and underachievement
 <br><br>
 Despite the popularity of these narratives, available archaeological or linguistic evidence since the 1960s does not support the external origins of the Gã or connections to biblical lands. Archaeologists and historians firmly place the origins of Gã and Danme cultures and identities in the lower Volta basin. From this base, the proto-Gã spread gradually, probably beginning at the end of the first millennium of the Common Era and over centuries absorbed, and assimilated the aboriginal Guan-speaking Obutu, Kpeshi
 and Kyerɛροη communities across the western half of the Accra Plains. These gradual intermingling of different speech and ethnic communities led to the creation of a composite Ga identity by the fifteenth century. While the Danme occupied the eastern Accra Plains and the Krobo hills, modern Gã identity and language crystallised on the western half of the plains, particularly around the kingdom of Great Accra. This early seventeenth century polity was founded by the second Gã king, Ayite with its capital at Ayawaso (around the modern township of Pokuase in the Greater Accra Region), an urban and agrarian settlement with a population of roughly 20,000 by the mid-

seventeenth century. <br> <br>
Reindorf may have contributed to the popularization of the idea that the Gã adopted the concept of secular kingship only after the fall of Ayawaso and from the Akan. Though the Gå borrowed aspects of Akan state craft particularly the eighteenth century, thes processes did not include th concept of secular kingship The king of Great Accra, Ayitey and his successors
appear to have relinquished

priestly duties to the Nae

Wulomo in the early sixteenth

century. Despite Great Accra's

overarching political dominance

of the Ga-speaking world,

each settlement maintained its

internal structures and therefore

the separation of priestly and

secular offices occurred at

different times. The creation

of a centralized secular state

at Ayawaso was a culmination

of several processes

including political struggles

with Europeans and African

polities, the increasing volume

of trade and Great Accra's

dominance of the Accra Plains

and beyond. But the political

dominance of Great Accra also

came at a cost. For example,in 1614, German traveller, Samuel Brun reported that the Gã lived in "great enmity with their neighbours."4 By 1634, when Great Accra was at the height of its power, it comprise Ayawaso, Little Accra (the coast), Labadi and Ningo.

Great Accra also dominated th Dangme-speakinregions to the Volta and Akmu to the northwest of Ayavaso. The wealth, gold ornaments and th military expeditions of the kings
of Great Accra does not in any way indicate that these were priests or wulomai.<br> <br>

With the construction of the

Dutch fort Crèvecœur in 1642

and the Danish and English

forts in 1661 and 1674, the

Gã effectively began to control

trade and wealth flows coming

in from the Atlantic world. As

middlemen, the Gã produced

salt, dried fish, beads, and

pottery and carried that in

addition torted European

and Indles into the Akan

interior change for gold

and captives. The Gã also had

a thriving economy of pottery

making, textile weaving, iron,

and gold smithing. The people

of La were particularly known

for their coarse cotton cloths

considered in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to be the garment of choice for Gã men of noble birth. Eventually, the Gã imported cheaper European and South Asian textiles and cotton prints which supplanted the Gã weaving industry by the end of the nineteenth century. However, the thriving and colourful Agbamavo textiles (colloquially called "Agotime kente") of the
Dãŋme-descended Agotime people is testament to the Accra Plains' rich heritage of textile weaving.
<br><br>
As trade with Europeans boosted the economy of the Western Accra Plains, the Gã Mäntsɛ, Manpon Okãi prevented the Akan groups in the interior from trading beyond the established market town of Abonse (in what is now Ghana's Eastern Region). Ironically, the peak of Gã political power also coincided with internal power struggles. Consequently, on 17th January 1642 disloyal generals murdered Mãnpon Okãi. In the ensuing succession disputes one of the late king's wives, the Obutu-bore Dode Akaibi (see the sound on this female ruler) sed polverвис ruled as regent fokhorloor... son, Okãi Kol. in less than an decade, Akaibi was murdered for her supposed "wickedness" and was succeeded by Okãi Koi, arguably the most well- known Gã king. As internal power struggles raged, the Gã became vulnerable to Akwamu,

an Akan state which Great Accra had once dominated.

<br><br>
Between 1677 and 1680, the expansionist Akan-speaking state of Akwamu directed its imperial gaze on the Gã kingdom and sought to wrestle control of European trading forts on the Accra littoral. The Akwamu invaded and destroyed Great Accra and executed King Okãi Koi in 1677 (some later traditions recorded by Reindorf claim that the king committed suicide). In the chaos of the conflict, Gã royals and refugees fled to the so-called Slave Coast (roughly the coastal area between east of the Volta River and Lagos/Badagry) and founded Anexo (Aneho) and<br>

Glidzi in what is now Togo. However, majority of the Gã fled to the littoral and negotiated the founding
 of modern Accra as settlements adjoining the Dutch, British and Danish forts - Crèvecoeur, James Fort and Christiansborg
  Castle. Kinkã (Dutch Accra) and Dleshi (James Town or British Accra) together constituted Gã Mãshi or Accra proper and was made up of seven quarters (Gã: akutsei; sing. akutso). Kinkã comprised Asεσε, Gbèsé, Abola and Otublohum. James Town or Dleshi comprised Sempe,
 Akãnmāji (or Akumaji) and Alata. From the late seventeenth century onwards, as the political dominance of Great Accra waned, the Ga Mashi and other Ga-speaking peoples successively re- constituted themselves into a loose confederacy of seven autonomous coastal towns - Accra, Osu, La (Labadi), Teshi, Nungua and Tema - each tied to several inland dependent villages and settlements across the western Accra Plains. Each coastal town also developed a strong republican ethos that checked the power of the mantse (chief or king; literally, "town father")

</p>In 1742, a coalition of Gã and Akyem forces rebelled against Akwamu and sacked that kingdom, reducing its territory to a tiny polity which became known as Akwamufie on the banks of the Volta River. IN process, the Late, Kyera and other hilly Guan-sph groups who had invited t Akyem to help them oust the Akwamu regime, joined forces with their new Akan allies to create the Akuapem state. The term Akuapem is derived from the Twi, “akuw apem," meaning "a thousand companies."

The new state was founded on the ridge overlooking the Accra Plains in 1733. In the aftermath of the Akwamu sack the ground rents for the Danish, Dutch and British forts of Christiansborg, Crèvecoeur and James passed on to the three Akyem states of Kotoku, Bosome and Abuakwa.
<br><br>
In 1742, the Asante overran and defeated the Akyem states and brought the southeastern Gold Coast under its political orbit. While the 
Asante did mot sack Accra like the had Hone in Akyem, that p e-manded yearly tribes om the Gã. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Gã stayed away from conflicts between the Fante and Asante But Asante harassments of the Gã polity in the 1810s, coupled with their increasing demands of expensive tributes in captives and goods, would drive Accra into greater allianc with the Fante and the British. Follow the lead of the Ga Mantoki Kome and other Gã rules, Accra's leading Eur African merchants abandoned their earlier pro-Asante policies as such strategies failed to guarantee peace or a conducive atmosphere for trade.
<br><br>
In 1823, when the Fante and their British allies were preparing to go to war with Asante, the then thirty-three- year-old James Samuel Bannerman (1790-1858), a prominent Accra merchant "garrisoned the Forts with 130 men paid, clothed, and equipped at his own expense" at a cost of £5000 (equivalent of £733,934.23 as at October 2023). 10 Besides Bannerman's efforts, the Gã contributed munitions and men in support of the British effort in what became known as the Battle
of Nsamankow. In the ensuing battle, the Asante defeated the Gold Coast alliance and the young governor of the British Forts and Set-tlements, Charles McCarthy was beheaded, and his body was never recovered.

Prior to the commencement of the Battle of Katamanso, fought, near Dodowa, on 7th August 1826, the Asante vowed to punish the Gã for supporting the Fante and the Britishكثر Nsamankow. By this Gã had allied with the the Danes, Fante, Akya Denkyira and surprisingly Akwamu. The latter had been long-time Asante allies. In Accra, the principal Euro- African merchants of Accra namely, John W. Hansen (d.1840) and James Bannerman both of James Town and Henrich Richter (1785-1849) of Osu fought in the war and contributed a private army of 500 well-drilled slave militia in support of the troops of the Gã Mãntse and the other nantsemei and asafoi (militia) of towns stretching from Gã Mashi (Accra) to Tema and eyond.11 The Osu and Accra erchants, particularly Richter ported state of the art
weaponry, including the newly invented Congreve rockets and two brass one-pounder field pieces. 12 Though British Involvement in the war was important, their contributions are often exaggerated in later sources. The British establishment on the Gold Coast provided 60 marines. But what is often touted as superior British firepower such as Congreve Rockets and artillery pieces were largely supplied by Accra's Euro-African merchants. Richter for example supplied virtually all the arms the Danish establishment needed for both the Battles of Nsamankow and Katamanso.14
        <br><br>
        In 1824, the Danish establishment in Osu bought 265 guns for £1 sh. 10 a piece for the war effort. Two years later in preparation for the Katamanso war, the Danes purchased supplies from Richter, including 50 barrels of powder, 2,400 cabes cowries, 20,000 flints as well a lead, rum, and red damask an taffetta for a total of £910.15 In addition to these, Richter sent   
        115 of his own slave militia whom he armed with arms and ammunition. Seven of these men were reportedly killed and twenty-six in addition to Richter were injured. In comparison, the private Danish merchants in Osu, George Lutterodt and J. Aarestrup, sent 36 and 50 men respectively, while Hansen contributed 100 combatants.16 In fact, it's more historically accurate to speak of the Battles of Nsamankow and Katamanso as Gold Coast-Asante wars rather than Anglo-Asante wars as we have it in colonial and postcolonial Ghanaian school textbooks.
         <br><br> 
       
        During the battle, the Asante had to contend with a combined force of Akyem, Gã/ Dãŋme, and Fante of roughly equal numerical strength as the invading force. By all accounts, the Asante largely broke into the Akyem and Fante ranks at Akuapem, virtually routing them. Consequently, the Gã and the Danme were largely lef to their own fate. In the end, combination of several factors including an overstretched and overworked Asante army
        superior Gã firepower (thanks mainly to Bannerman, Richter, and Hansen) and the sheer determination of the Accra people led to Asante defeat.

        By daybreak on August 7, 1826, the firing of Congreve rockets caused confusion and chaos in the Asante ranks. As the battle got tougher, the Accra troops engaged in hand-to-hand combat and artillery fire with the Asante. When the battle finally ended, an estimate 6000- 8000 Asante had pushed at Katamanso and this included some of that nation's most skilled administrators, chiefs and soldiers. As it became apparent that the Asante were osing the battle, Asantehene Osee Yaw Akoto fled the
        
        battle scene and made it to Kumase. The Asantehene had suffered personal injury on the battlefield, and he never recovered from the psychological toll of defeat and loss. Osee Yaw Akoto's "favorite wife," Akua Pusuwa and two of their daughters, Yo Hom and Manuaa and ove thirty other high-profile Asante were captured. The captive Asante 
        royal women included Akyaawa Yikwan (Yaa Akyaa) of Akorase, a daughter of Asantehene, Osee Kwadwo (1764-77), who was a paternal granddaughter of the Akyempenhene, Oheneba Owusu Afriyie. The latter had first brought Accra and the southeastern Gold Coast under Asante control in 1742.
        <br><br>
        The defeat at Katamanso was a national catastrophe which was never forgotten in Asante royal circles. Nearly a century, after the battle, Asantehene Perempe II recounted that Osse Yaw Akoto's predecessor, Osse Tutu Kwame on his deathbed had warned the future Asantehene against picking up arms against "white men" on the coast. Historian Carl Reindorf, similarly, recalls a tradition, likely recounted to him by his in-law, Yaa Hom who was also Osee Yaw's daughter that the oracles warned against waging war on Accra. Sadly, Osse Yaw suffered bouts of depression and alcoholism until his death in 1834.

While the Battle of Katamanso was the worse military defeat in Asante history up to that point, the conflict remains an important memory of 
Gã resilience and independence. In a letter to British official Col. Purdon, dated 7th September 1826, Merchants Richter and Hansen 
chastised what they deemed as a selfish British establishment, reconsidering trade with Asante at the expense of Gã security and freedom,
 less than a month after the end of the battle. "The Battle of Dodowa," Richter and Hansen asserted, "has given liberty to thousands yet 
 unborn [...]. Would you again restore them to the merciless Ashanti [..] for the sake of a little trade? [...] We can do without their 
 trade for two, three, four or five years." In commemoration of their vic-tory, the Gã renamed the Nungua-owned village of Ahiam, near the site of the battle as Katamanso. This renaming was in mockery of Osse Yaw's boastful oath to push the Gã into the belly of the small flat sea fishes known in Gã as kãnfrã. The Gã victors yelled in Twi, "wo ka ntam na wo so ye" ("You [the Asante- hene Osee Yaw] swore an oath, yet you are weeping"). The expression was later contracted to Kataman-so, after which Ahiam village and the battle were both named.

 To normalize relations between the polities of the Gold Coast, the British and Danes on one hand and the Asante on the other hand, 
 the Treaty of Fomena was signed in 1831. In this Treaty, Asante relinquished all claims of sovereignty over the Gold Coast and peace 
 reigned for a near absolute peace prevailed until the 1850s.In the aftermath of the war, Akua Pusuwa and his family resided permanently in Accra, occasionally visiting Kumase. It is important to mention that Akua Pusuwa was a politically astute and wise woman who wanted the best for her daughters. She not only readily aligned herself with the Houses of Bannerman and Richter, the most important trading establishments on the Gold Coast at the time, but also secured her freedom through these alliances. Pusuwa's two daughters married Bannerman and Richter re-spectively and this ensured greater commercial and diplomatic advantages between the establishments of the two Euro- African gentlemen and Kumase.
